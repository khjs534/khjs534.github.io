          <p>After graduating from Dev Bootcamp I found myself trying to make a personal website with the tools that DBC had provided for me. Since the program taught Ruby on Rails I figured making a portfolio page with Ruby was right up my alley.</p>

<p>Researching the tools out there I settled on Middleman because it seemed like a reliable static site generator that would fit my needs.</p>

<p><img src="/images/middleman.svg" alt="Middleman" width="200px" /></p>

<p>Since this Middleman is part of thoughtbot, I thought deviating from vanilla javascrpt would be a good learning experience and experiment in learning sass. I decided to use Bourbon, Bitters and Neat to try nd stylize my portfolio.</p>

<p>I used a tutorial for reference and a lot has changed since the publication of the tutorial. As a result there were a lot of issues that sprang up. Neat deprecated several containers and adjusting how scss imported the correct libraries was a small learning curve.</p>

<p>Some main take aways I learned from this project is that reading the documentation and changelogs is very important. Major changes can happen after something is written and using it as a reference the responsibility falls on you to connect the dots and make things work.</p>
