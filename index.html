      <p><strong>Necropolis</strong> is a game of combat and survival, set in a magical labyrinth full of traps and swarms of monsters. There are several levels to the dungeon and they are partly randomly generated. You'll see similar things on particular levels but they are randomly generated to that theme.</p>
      <p>The game is up to four players and scales accordingly. It's a great game to play with friends and even better if you're all on a discord channel or teamspeak. There are great elements of the game that really make you feel like you are delving into the dungeon.</p>
      <p>Here are some facts about Necropolis:</p>

    <p>When creating this page I thought of freecodecamp.com's tribute page assignment. The assignment was to create a tribute page for certain individuals. Instead of creating a tribute page for a person I made one for a game that I'm currently fond of. You can see this tribute page <a href="http://codepen.io/santic/full/Rrvgoq/">here</a>. To see the html with codepen.io click "Change View" and select editor mode or click <a href="http://codepen.io/santic/pen/Rrvgoq">here</a>. This webpage makes use of css for formating, but just from looking at the html it makes great use of classes and stylizing classes. Additionally it uses bootstrap well. This gives it a very clean look with borders and makes it feel more complete. many of the html elements are recognizable, but there are many we have yet to touch on.</p>
