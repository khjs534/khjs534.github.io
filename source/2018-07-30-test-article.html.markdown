After graduating from Dev Bootcamp I found myself trying to make a personal website with the tools that DBC had provided for me. Since the program taught Ruby on Rails I figured making a portfolio page with Ruby was right up my alley.

Researching the tools out there I settled on Middleman because it seemed like a reliable static site generator that would fit my needs.

Since this Middleman is part of thoughtbot, I thought deviating from vanilla javascrpt would be a good learning experience and experiment in learning sass. I decided to use Bourbon, Bitters and Neat to try nd stylize my portfolio.
